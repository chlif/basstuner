# Bass guitar tuner

This is a very basic Web Audio API demo built to tune your bass guitar.

## Usage

Clone the repository and go to the root folder.

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` with your browser.

## Note

I would not use this just before you climb to stage. ;) Obviously it's not yet quite ready. It's a demo, not production ready production.
